## General Outline
`terminal-tower-defense` (ttd) is a hybrid game combining tower defense and factory simulation genres. Played entirely in the terminal, it leverages VT-100 escape sequences for a platform-independent display. The game runs as a daemon in the background and is interfaced via the command line, using commands prefixed with `ttd`.
